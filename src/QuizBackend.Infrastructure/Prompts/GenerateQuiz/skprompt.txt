Generate a quiz in JSON format based on the following content: "{{$content}}". 
The quiz should contain exactly "{{$numberOfQuestions}}" questions, **all of which must be of the type** "{{$typeOfQuestions}}".

Important rules based on "{{$typeOfQuestions}}":

1. **If "{{$typeOfQuestions}}" is "SingleChoice"**:  
   - Each question must have **exactly 4 unique answers**, with only **one correct answer**.
   - The structure for **every** question should be **strictly 4 answers**, regardless of the content or diversity.
   - You can use a variety of question formulations like: "What is...", "Which of the following...", "How does...", "Explain why...".
   - Ensure that all questions are **clear and directly related to the core content**.

2. **If "{{$typeOfQuestions}}" is "TrueFalse"**:  
   - Each question must have **exactly 2 answers**: "true" and "false", with only **one correct answer**.
   - Ensure that the **correct answer** is **either "true" or "false"** and is placed correctly in the "IsCorrect" field.
   - **Do not generate more than 2 answers**. There should be no additional distractors.
   - You can use a variety of question formulations like: "Is [statement] true?", "Is [statement] false?", "[Statement] is true/false.", "True or false: [statement]?".
   - Ensure the statements are **unambiguous** and easy to classify as either true or false, particularly for specialized content.

3.**If "{{$typeOfQuestions}}" is "SingleChoice+TrueFalse"**:  
   - Split the quiz evenly between **SingleChoice** and **TrueFalse** questions.
   - If the number of questions is odd, assign one more question to SingleChoice.
   - For **SingleChoice** questions, each question must have 4 unique answers, with one correct answer.
   - For **TrueFalse** questions, each question must have exactly 2 answers: "true" and "false", with only one correct answer.

4. **Do not mix question types** unless "{{$typeOfQuestions}}" explicitly specifies "SingleChoice+TrueFalse".  
   - If "SingleChoice" is selected, **all** questions must have 4 answers.
   - If "TrueFalse" is selected, **all** questions must have 2 answers (true/false).
   - If "SingleChoice+TrueFalse" is specified, generate a mix of both formats, but **keep each question strictly within its format**.

**IMPORTANT** REMEMBER:  
- **Do not mix question types** unless specifically instructed with "SingleChoice+TrueFalse".
- Always generate **four answers** for SingleChoice and **two answers** for TrueFalse.

Content and Diversity:
- Ensure that questions accurately reflect the core content and cover **different subtopics**.
- Maintain diversity within the **content** of the questions but **do not alter the structure** of answers (stick to 4 answers for SingleChoice and 2 answers for TrueFalse).

Question and Answer Quality:
- Ensure all questions are clear, concise, and directly related to the content.
- Avoid ambiguous or overly complex phrasing.
- The correct answer should be unmistakably correct, but distractors should be plausible.
