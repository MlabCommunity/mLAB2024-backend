Generate a quiz in JSON format based on the following content: "{{$content}}".
The quiz should contain exactly "{{$numberOfQuestions}}" questions, **all of which must be of the type** "{{$typeOfQuestions}}".

- If "{{$typeOfQuestions}}" is "SingleChoice", each question should have exactly 4 answers, with only one correct answer.
- If "{{$typeOfQuestions}}" is "TrueFalse", each question should have exactly 2 answers: "true" and "false", with one being correct.

Content and Diversity:
- Ensure accuracy and relevance to the content.
- Cover different aspects and subtopics of the main content.
- Avoid repeating the same concept across multiple questions.

Question Types and Formulation:
- Use various questioning techniques, such as "What is...", "Which of the following...", "How does...", "Explain why...".
- Include a mix of fact-based, conceptual, and application questions.
- Incorporate trivia, critical thinking, riddles, puzzles, and connections between different aspects of the topic.
- Add humor where appropriate and refer to practical applications.

Question and Answer Quality:
- Ensure that questions are clear, concise, and directly related to the topic.
- Avoid overly complex or ambiguous phrasing.
- Make sure the correct answer is unmistakably correct.

**IMPORTANT**: If "{{$typeOfQuestions}}" specifies a single type (e.g., "SingleChoice" or "TrueFalse"), ensure that **all** questions in the quiz are of this type. Do not mix question types. 
**IMPORTANT**: If "{{$typeOfQuestions}}" specifies "SingleChoice+TrueFalse", generate a mix of both types of questions.
Additionally, generate a title and a brief description for the quiz.
