Based on the generated quiz: {{$jsonResponse}}.
Check whether the quiz matches the JSON pattern based on "{{$typeOfQuestions}}" type of questions. If not, adjust the questions and answers to match the pattern **strictly**.

Make sure you return the quiz in the provided language: {{$language}}.
The matched quiz should contain exactly {{$numberOfQuestions}} questions.

**IMPORTANT: Strictly adhere to the following patterns based on question type.**  
When the number of questions is greater than 10, ensure that **every question** conforms exactly to the specified format.

1. **If {{$typeOfQuestions}} is "SingleChoice"**:

- Every question must follow this structure:
{
  "title": "generated quiz title",
  "description": "generated quiz description",
  "generateQuestions": [
    {
      "title": "1. [Single Choice Question 1]",
      "generateAnswers": [
        {
          "content": "generated Answer 1",
          "isCorrect": false
        },
        {
          "content": "generated Answer 2",
          "isCorrect": true
        },
        {
          "content": "generated Answer 3",
          "isCorrect": false
        },
        {
          "content": "generated Answer 4",
          "isCorrect": false
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

2. **If {{$typeOfQuestions}} is "TrueFalse"**:
{
  "title": "generated quiz title",
  "description": "generated quiz description",
  "generateQuestions": [
    {
      "title": "1. [TrueFalse Question 1]",
      "generateAnswers": [
        {
          "content": "true",
          "isCorrect": true
        },
        {
          "content": "false",
          "isCorrect": false
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

3. **If {{$typeOfQuestions}} is "SingleChoice+TrueFalse"**:
Use an alternating pattern, but **each question** must adhere to its format (SingleChoice with 4 answers, TrueFalse with 2 answers).

**When the quiz contains more than 10 questions**, do not change the pattern or introduce mixed types within a single question.
