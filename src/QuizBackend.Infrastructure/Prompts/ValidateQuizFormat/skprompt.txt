  "description": "generated quiz description",
  "generateQuestions": [
    {
      "title": "1. [Single Choice Question 1]",
      "generateAnswers": [
        {
          "content": "generated Answer 1",
          "isCorrect": false
        },
        {
          "content": "generated Answer 2",
          "isCorrect": true
        },
        {
          "content": "generated Answer 3",
          "isCorrect": false
        },
        {

          "isCorrect": false
        },
        {

      "generateAnswers": [
        {
          "content": "generated Answer 1",
          "isCorrect": false
        },

          "isCorrect": false
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

2. **If {{$typeOfQuestions}} is "TrueFalse"**:
{
  "title": "generated quiz title",
  "description": "generated quiz description",
  "generateQuestions": [
    {
      "title": "1. [TrueFalse Question 1]",
      "generateAnswers": [
        {
          "content": "[true translated to prvoided language {{$language}}]",
          "isCorrect": true
        },
        {
          "content": "[false translated to prvoided language {{$language}}]",

          "isCorrect": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

3. **If {{$typeOfQuestions}} is "SingleChoice+TrueFalse"**:
